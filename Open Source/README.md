# Open Source

Hey guys! Welcome to week one of **Induction 2021**. We will be learning all about git and github this week.

## What You are Gonna Learn:

- About GitHub website
- Basic GitHub terminologies
- All About git tool ( with git bash )
- Basic Git GitHub Workflow (To-the-point well-illustrated `git bash` notes)

---------------------
## The Plan

This Open-Source section is divided into two parts

Participants are required to submit their Tasks in one week time.

The first task is provided in the [/Git1](./Git1/README.md) folder.

The second task **will be** provided in [/Git2](./Git2/README.md) folder.
Information will be provided in our discord server regarding the release of second task.

> **About submitting your work**
>
> **You will `create Pull Requests` to this repository in order to submit your work.** <br>
> Now what is Pull Request? Follow the git notes and you shall know!

-----------------------
## What should I do if I get stuck?

Each of the tasks will take 1 day at max. You should work and ask your doubts in the discord server's `#ask-your-doubts` channel to reach us out.

**REMEMBER**: Try to solve your doubts by yourself by simply googling first.  
_Stack overflow_ website might show up the answer to solve your doubt!

------------------
## About the notes

Both git bash notes and Github Desktop app notes can be used to complete the Tasks.

But, We highly recommend and encourage you to follow the git bash notes instead of the Github Desktop app notes.


Git bash notes is curated by your mentors only. We have written those from scratch and those are to-the-point notes. Perfectly illustrated!

### Why you should use a git bash terminal instead of the beautiful Github Desktop App?
- Working with terminal commands is faster than clicking buttons and waiting for the app to load.
- Your life as a developer will be so much better with git bash unix like commands.
