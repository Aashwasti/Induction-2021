Hey guys! Welcome to week one of **Induction 2021**. We will be learning all about git and github this week.

## What You are Gonna Learn:

## The Plan

This Open-Source section is divided into two parts

Participants are required to submit their Tasks in one week time.

The first task is provided in the [/Git1](./Git1/README.md) folder.

The second task **will be** provided in [/Git2](./Git2/README.md) folder.
Information will be provided in our discord server regarding the release of second task.

> **About submitting your work**
>
> **You will `create Pull Requests` to this repository in order to submit your work.** <br>
> Now what is Pull Request? Follow the git notes and you shall know!

-----------------------
## What should I do if I get stuck?

Each of the tasks will take 1 day at max. You should work and ask your doubts in the discord server's `#ask-your-doubts` channel to reach us out.

**REMEMBER**: Try to solve your doubts by yourself by simply googling first.  
_Stack overflow_ website might show up the answer to solve your doubt!
